Welcome to the Lab!

We are located at the University of Bath in the South West of England. Besides the glorious landscape we have specialised optics labs, fibre drawing tower and a modern cleanroom. 

The main themes of research we explore are: 

 <br> 
**Nano- and microlaser development
-Unconventional cavities
-Random lasers 
-Whispering gallery mode laser 
 <br> 
**Development of optical bio-sensors
-exploring optical phenomena for sensing
-bioresponfive sensors
-biointegration
 <br> 
**Development of novel imaging and spectroscopic techniques
-Fast spectroscopy
-Hyperspectral imaging
