Welcome to the Lab!

We are located at the University of Bath in the South West of England. Besides the glorious landscape we have specialised optics labs, fibre drawing tower and a modern cleanroom. 

The main themes of research we explore is: 

  Micro and nanolaser development





The Biointegrated Photonics laboratory of Jun.-Prof. Dr. Marcel Schubert is specialised in the development of microscopic lasers and biocompatible optical devices for biomedical applications. The lab is part of the Humboldt Centre for Nano and Biophotonics which was established at the Institute of Physical Chemistry in 2020. The centre provides access to state-of-the-art optics labs, a new-built cleanroom, as well as in-house cell culture and nanofabrication facilities. Our main research activities include:
 <br> 
**Nano- and microlaser development
-Unconventional cavities
-Random lasers 
-Whispering gallery mode laser 
 <br> 
**Development of optical bio-sensors
-exploring optical phenomena for sensing
-bioresponfive sensors
-biointegration
 <br> 
**Development of novel imaging and spectroscopic techniques
-Fast spectroscopy
-Hyperspectral imaging
