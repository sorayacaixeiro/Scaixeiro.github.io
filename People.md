I earned my PhD in Physics from King's College London in 2018, focusing on [lasing from Biomaterials](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/125711631/2018_Caixeiro_Soraya_Carlos_1011922_ethesis.pdf). 
Following that, I joined the Soft Matter Photonics Group at the University of St Andrews, UK, in 2018. 
In 2021, the lab moved to establish the Humboldt Centre for Nano- and Biophotonics at the University of Cologne, Germany. 
Eventually, in September 2023, I became a tenure track [Prize Fellow in Healthcare in the Department of Physics](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/soraya-caixeiro) at the University of Bath, UK.

I am a fourth-year university student undertaking an integrated master's in Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Bath, to be completed in 2025. I am currently working on a Rank Prize studentship with Soraya in the rapid detection of laser wavelengths, with the aim of rapid identification of microlasers in biological applications.
