   abstract = {Intracellular lasers are emerging as powerful biosensors for multiplexed large-scale tracking and precision sensing of cells and their microenvironment. These novel microlasers must be supported by instruments that can cater to the rapid widefield quantification of the sparse and narrow-linewidth of the laser emission spectra. In this work, we demonstrate snapshot hyper-spectral imaging of disk lasers. By using integral field mapping using a microlens array and a diffraction grating, we can image spatial and spectral intensity in a single widefield camera acquisition. We demonstrate rapid volumetric imaging and wide-field imaging over a > 3 × 3 mm field of view (FOV). Through detailed calibration experiments, we evaluate the performance and outline the challenges and strengths of snapshot methods in the context of the characteristics of disk laser emission. With careful design, snapshot hyperspectral imaging can offer new opportunities for many high-throughput applications.

   abstract = {Multiplexed, specific, and sensitive detection of antigens is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of disease and the informed development of personalized treatment plans. Here, it is shown that polymer microsphere lasers can be used as photonic sensors to monitor and quantify direct surface binding of biomolecules via changes in the refractive index. The unique spectral signature of each individual laser can be used to find their size and effective refractive index which adds a new encoding dimension when compared to conventional fluorescent beads. Antibody-functionalized microlasers selectively detect protein binding, as demonstrated for Immunoglobulin G and C-reactive protein, and have the ability to resolve different stages of the multilayer surface modification. Moreover, by continuously monitoring single lasers, the possibility of real-time monitoring of binding dynamics between antigens in solution phase and the immobilized antibodies is demonstrated. For multiplexed detection, the microlasers are employed in a flow cytometer configuration, with fast spectral detection and identification of microlasers with and without antigen binding. It is envisioned that by combining microlasers with well-established surface modification chemistries and flow geometries, the multiplexing ability of microbead immunoassays can be strongly increased while also opening avenues for single-cell profiling within heterogeneous cell populations.},

   abstract = {Biointegrated intracellular microlasers have emerged as an attractive and versatile tool in biophotonics. Different inorganic semiconductor materials have been used for the fabrication of such biocompatible microlasers but often operate at visible wavelengths ill-suited for imaging through tissue. Here, we report on whispering gallery mode microdisk lasers made from a range of GaInP/AlGaInP multi-quantum well structures with compositions tailored to red-shifted excitation and emission. The selected semiconductor alloys show minimal toxicity and allow the fabrication of lasers with stable single-mode emission in the NIR (675-720 nm) and sub-pJ thresholds. The microlasers operate in the first therapeutic window under direct excitation by a conventional diode laser and can also be pumped in the second therapeutic window using two-photon excitation at pulse energies compatible with standard multiphoton microscopy. Stable performance is observed under cell culturing conditions for 5 days without any device encapsulation. With their bio-optimized spectral characteristics, low lasing threshold, and compatibility with two-photon pumping, AlGaInP-based microlasers are ideally suited for novel cell tagging and in vivo sensing applications.},

   abstract = {Here, we investigate the mechanism of a random-lasing-based sensor which shows pH sensitivity exceeding by 2 orders of magnitude that of a conventional fluorescence sensor. We explain the sensing mechanism as related to gain modifications and lasing-threshold nonlinearities. A dispersive diffusive lasing theory matches the experimental results well, and it allows us to predict the optimal sensing conditions and a maximal sensitivity as large as 200 times that of an identical fluorescence-based sensor. The lack of complex alignment and the high sensitivity make this mechanism promising for future biosensing applications.},

Cellulose fibers, such as the one extracted form cotton or woodpulp, have been used by humankind for hundreds of years to make textiles and paper. Here we show how, by engineering light−matter interaction, we can optimize light scattering using exclusively cellulose nanocrystals. The produced material is sustainable, biocompatible, and when compared to ordinary microfiber-based paper, it shows enhanced scattering strength (×4), yielding a transport mean free path as low as 3.5 μm in the visible light range. The experimental results are in a good agreement with the theoretical predictions obtained with a diffusive model for light propagation.},

We study the Kerr nonlinearity associated with cross-phase modulation based on electromagnetically induced transparency. Our results show, in this closed-loop system, that the strength of cross-phase modulation and two-photon absorption are dependent critically on the relative phase between the excitation paths. By choosing the parameters appropriately, large cross-phase modulation can be achieved within a wide transparency window, while two-photon absorption is cancelled completely. The strength of cross-phase modulation can be enhanced much more by decreasing the intensities of two driven fields.},

KGaA, Weinheim Biolasers obtained from biomaterials are attracting a wealth of interest for their potential as future biosensors with enhanced sensitivity, and advanced cell tracking. Here, miniature biolasers are reported, which are formed by bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein and biosourced polysaccharides derived from land plants such as cellulose and pectin. Using a green processing route aided by simple emulsions, solid-state microspheres with diameters of 15–100 µm are fabricated and utilized as whispering gallery mode lasers with thresholds of a few µJ mm–2 and quality factors of up to 3000. Furthermore, BSA microlasers are found to be compatible with cell growth and resistant to the aqueous environment of cell culture media. This environmentally friendly and biocompatible design shows promise for future implantable biosensing devices opening a path between laser science and medicine.},
