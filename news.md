## New publication in Nature Protocols

check out: [Hyperspectral confocal imaging for high-throughput readout and analysis of bio-integrated microlasers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-023-00924-6)
Fantastic work by PhD student [Vera Titze](https://twitter.com/TitzeVera?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and co-authors. A culmination of years of work led by the [Gather Lab](https://gatherlab.uni-koeln.de/) and the [Schubert Lab](https://schubert-lab.uni-koeln.de/), it was lovely to have contribuited to this work and see it take shape over the years.
