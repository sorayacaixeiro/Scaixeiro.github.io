## June
**Invited Talk** Biogenic Materials Science Workshop TUM Campus Straubing 
I will be at the Technical University of Munich on the 6th and 7th June for the Biogenic Materials Science Workshop, looking forward to some great science and discussions! 

## May
**New paper** 
Check out [Estimating full-field displacement in biological images using deep learning](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.21.595161v1) Led by Master student Solomon Warsop and supervised by Dr. Philip Wijesinghe and Dr. Graham D. Bruce! Comes with a ImageJ/Fiji plugin to analyse deformation in biological tissue!

## March
**Pub lecture**
On the 14th of March I will be at the The Canon (1 Barton St, Bath BA1 1HQ) @8pm to give a lecture titled: Illuminate, detect, track with miniturised lasers. Event organised by **SU PhySoc**

## January 
**New publication in Nature Protocols**
check out: [Hyperspectral confocal imaging for high-throughput readout and analysis of bio-integrated microlasers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-023-00924-6)
Fantastic work by PhD student [Vera Titze](https://twitter.com/TitzeVera?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and co-authors. A culmination of years of work led by the [Gather Lab](https://gatherlab.uni-koeln.de/) and the [Schubert Lab](https://schubert-lab.uni-koeln.de/), it was lovely to have contribuited to this work and see it take shape over the years.
