**Dr. Soraya Caixeiro (Group Leader)**

Prize Fellow in health care for Physics, Department of Physics

I earned my PhD in Physics from King's College London in 2018, focusing on [lasing from Biomaterials](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/125711631/2018_Caixeiro_Soraya_Carlos_1011922_ethesis.pdf). 
Following that, I joined the Soft Matter Photonics Group at the University of St Andrews, UK, in 2018. 
In 2021, the lab moved to establish the Humboldt Centre for Nano- and Biophotonics at the University of Cologne, Germany. 
Eventually, in September 2023, I became a tenure track [Prize Fellow in Healthcare in the Department of Physics](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/soraya-caixeiro) at the University of Bath, UK.

# Research interests
I have a keen interest in leveraging the field of photonics, with a specific emphasis on the development and application of micro- and nanolasers for a wide range of sensing and captivating biological and medical applications.

I aim to enhance the efficiency, tunability, and versatility of small lasers. Harnessing the unique properties of light from compact and efficient laser sources which can be tailored and integrated into various sensing platforms.

Small lasers have been employed for highly sensitive and specific detection of biomolecules, with the potential to impact early disease diagnosis and monitoring. They can also be utilised in cutting-edge imaging techniques, enabling researchers to explore the intricacies of cellular and molecular processes.

In essence, my research represents a multidisciplinary approach, amalgamating nanofabrication, chemistry, and photonics, all converging to advance our understanding and application of these technologies in the realms of biology and medicine.
