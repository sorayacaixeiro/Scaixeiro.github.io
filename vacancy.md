I consistently seek out promising prospective students and research scientists particularly in the domains of microlasers, nanolasers, nanophotonics, material science, and biosensors.
While open calls for opportunities can be found below, there are also numerous possibilities for self-funded scholarships, particular funding avaliable from students from the Americas and China and early-career PhD holders to seek funding to join my research group. I am dedicated to supporting their applications, so please feel free to contact me without hesitation.

# PhD positions 

**I have several competitively funded PhD projects starting in September 2025**. 

[Functional Biointegrated Micro and Nanolaser Sensors for Tissue and Single-Cell Applications](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/faculty-of-science-ursa-phd-project-functional-biointegrated-micro-and-nanolaser-sensors-for-tissue-and-single-cell-applications/?p176163) This PhD project focuses on advancing biointegrated microlasers and nanolasers for real-time biosensing in complex tissue environments. The research will explore novel microlaser geometries, coatings, and modifications to enhance specificity and sensitivity for targeted biomolecular interactions. The project aims to pioneer in vivo measurements with high precision. The successful candidate will have access to cutting-edge nanofabrication and photonics labs and can tailor their research to areas such as nanofabrication, biological experiments, or computational modeling.

[Dynamic subcellular analysis of novel integrative biomaterials](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/swbio-dtp-dynamic-subcellular-analysis-of-novel-integrative-biomaterials/?p177087) This project aims to deepen our understanding of cellular mechanisms promoted by novel peptide-based biomaterials for tissue repair. By using advanced imaging techniques, we will track cell behavior, including motility and myogenic fiber formation, in 3D hydrogels. The goal is to refine material properties to create tailored solutions for regenerating different soft tissues and improving clinical outcomes. This is a funded PhD studentship open to all nationalities.
